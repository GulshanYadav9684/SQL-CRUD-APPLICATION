GUI CRUD APPLICATION
A GUI CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation refers to a set of interactive features within a graphical user interface (GUI) that allow users to perform basic data management tasks on a system. These operations are the core functionalities of many software applications. These are typically used to manage data within a database, file system, or other data storage solutions. Here's a breakdown of each operation in the context of GUI design:

Create (C) This operation allows the user to add new data to the system. In a GUI, this is often done through a form or input fields where the user can enter information (e.g., name, email, address) and then submit it to be saved in the database. Example: A "Create New Record" button that opens a form where users can enter new information.
Read (R) The Read operation retrieves and displays data that is stored in the system. In the GUI, this is typically presented as a table, list, or a detailed view of individual records, allowing users to browse through or search for specific data. Example: A "View Records" screen showing all records in a table, with options to search, filter, or paginate through them.
Update (U) This operation allows users to modify existing data. In the GUI, users select the item they want to update, often triggering an editable form or input fields that reflect the current values, where changes can be made. Example: A "Edit" button that allows the user to open an editable form, update details, and then save the changes.
Delete (D) The Delete operation removes data from the system. In a GUI, this is usually presented as a "Delete" button or option that confirms whether the user wants to permanently remove the data. Example: A "Delete" button next to each item in a list, with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletion.
